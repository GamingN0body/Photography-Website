                When I was twelve years old, my parents bought me my first camera.  It took me all of 2 minutes to go through the 23 pictures in the roll. I have never been so excited in my life, waiting for that perfect bird picture. There began my passion for photography.
            </p>
            <p class="about-input">
                I started my career in 2003 working with Larson Brothers as a school photographer. I love getting the opportunity to freeze time on the special moments. My favorite projects were always the family events at school. Later I went on to work for Milne Photography where I was able to establish my art.

            <p class="about-input">
                Untitled Photography was established in 2015. I have specialized in taking wedding, family and senior photography. I love going to the different locations and getting to know each client through my lens.
            </p>
            <p class="about-input">
                I encourage you to embrace each moment and in the quiet moments capture a picture. When you know you will not get that quiet it moment I am here to do it for you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
